Here's a quick summary of what we've accomplished so far and what could be next.

We've successfully created the core of the DocuCraft AI application. Here's a breakdown of the key features:

Project Creation & Setup: We started with a multi-step wizard to capture essential app metadata (name, industry, target users, etc.).
AI-Powered Content:
The app intelligently suggests core and optional features based on the initial metadata.
It automatically generates feature descriptions and drafts for the Product Vision and App Overview sections to give you a head start.
It creates detailed user personas with goals and frustrations.
Interactive Editor:
We built a two-panel interface with a Markdown editor and a live preview.
We added a powerful set of AI tools, including an "Improve Writing" assistant and a style toggle to rewrite content for different audiences (technical, friendly, investors, etc.).
Modular Document Structure: You have full control to enable or disable a wide range of document sections, from "User Flows" to "Deployment Plans," and the sidebar navigation updates dynamically.
Customization & Export: You can brand your documents with a custom logo and primary color, switch between light and dark modes, and export your final documentation as a PDF, DOCX, or Markdown file.
The application is quite powerful, but based on the original plan and potential improvements, here are some things we could work on next:

Template Library: We could create pre-built project templates for common app types like SaaS, e-commerce, or mobile apps to make getting started even faster.
Advanced Export Options: The groundwork is there, but we could fully implement the "Send to Google Docs," "Export to Trello," and "Export to Notion" features. This would require API integrations.
Full Collaboration Features: The UI for collaboration is in place. The next step would be to build the backend functionality to support real-time cursors, a commenting system, and version history, likely using a service like Firebase Firestore.
User Authentication & Cloud Storage: To save projects across devices and enable collaboration, we would need to add user login and move project storage from the browser's localStorage to a cloud database.
